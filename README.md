This is a basic poker game App for the Android Operating System.
This repo contains the entire Android Studio project and the app can therefore be deployed by using 
the IDE from JetBrains/IntelliJ and related Gradle/ADB tools.
It is a school project and there is at least one graphic that properly should not be used under
proper licensing terms, but the intention behind the project is to be mostly compliant
with at least the spirit of the GNU Public Licenses. Although, strictly speaking,
   it is simply a school project and the possibly copyrighted image 
   (the back of the Card graphic) we only claim to use under "Fair Use" 
   for educational purposes and so, may not properly fulfill the obligations of the actual GPL.

In lieu of proper text-based documentation, which was not required by the assignment, we have provided an explanatory video requested by the professor:
This video is too large for GitHub as it contains a relatively in depth explanation of the code and some personal tangents, 
     and it is therefore currently (as of 2021-01-01) hosted on a personal dropbox account:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/f0knijd7x4h6uqp/223j-project-video.mp4?dl=0

Should we decide to further extend on or iterate on this project, whether for personal reasons or for public consumption, the aforementioned issues will be addressed.
Credits for the main card graphics are screenshotted in a part of the video and if you would like to use this as a learning tool, the video should suffice as a basic guide to approaching a study of the code. But, otherwise, this should hopefully fulfill the requirements of the project as well as provide insight to anyone interested in using it.
